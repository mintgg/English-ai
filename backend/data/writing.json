    "model_answer": "Environmental protection has become one of the most pressing issues in today's world. With the rapid development of industry and technology, our environment is facing numerous problems such as air pollution, water pollution, deforestation, and climate change.\n\nThese environmental problems have a significant impact on human life. Air pollution can cause various respiratory diseases and even cancer. Water pollution affects the quality of drinking water and threatens aquatic life. Deforestation leads to soil erosion and loss of biodiversity. Climate change results in extreme weather conditions, rising sea levels, and the destruction of ecosystems.\n\nTo protect the environment, we can take several measures. First, governments should implement stricter environmental laws and regulations. Second, industries should adopt cleaner production technologies and reduce pollution. Third, individuals can contribute by reducing waste, conserving energy and water, recycling, and using public transportation instead of private cars. Additionally, we should plant more trees and raise public awareness about environmental protection.\n\nIn conclusion, environmental protection is crucial for the survival of human beings and all living creatures on Earth. We must take immediate action to protect our environment for ourselves and future generations."

    "title": "The Advantages and Disadvantages of Online Shopping",
    "topic": "Write an essay discussing the advantages and disadvantages of online shopping. Your essay should include:\n1. The main advantages of online shopping\n2. The main disadvantages of online shopping\n3. Your own opinion on online shopping",
    "type": "essay",
    "difficulty": 2,
    "model_answer": "With the development of the Internet, online shopping has become increasingly popular in recent years. Like any other form of shopping, online shopping has both advantages and disadvantages.\n\nOne of the main advantages of online shopping is convenience. People can shop at any time of the day or night without leaving their homes. They can browse through a wide variety of products and compare prices easily. Online shopping also offers a greater selection of goods than traditional stores, and it saves time and energy.\n\nHowever, online shopping also has some disadvantages. One major drawback is that customers cannot see or touch the products before purchasing, which may lead to dissatisfaction. There is also a risk of fraud and identity theft. Additionally, delivery may take time, and returning products can be complicated. Some people also miss the social aspect of traditional shopping.\n\nIn my opinion, online shopping is a convenient and efficient way to shop, but it should not completely replace traditional shopping. We should take advantage of the benefits of online shopping while being aware of its potential risks. For expensive or important purchases, it is better to visit physical stores. For everyday items and when we are short of time, online shopping is a good option."

    "type": "chart",
    "difficulty": 3,
    "model_answer": "The chart shows the changes in people's diet in China over a 40-year period from 1980 to 2020. It is clear from the chart that there have been significant changes in the consumption of different food groups.\n\nIn 1980, grain was the main component of the Chinese diet, accounting for about 60% of the total consumption. However, by 2020, this figure had decreased to approximately 30%. On the other hand, the consumption of meat, dairy products, and fruits and vegetables has increased considerably. The consumption of meat rose from about 10% in 1980 to 25% in 2020. Dairy products, which were almost negligible in 1980, reached about 15% of the diet by 2020. The consumption of fruits and vegetables increased from around 20% to 30% during the same period.\n\nThere are several factors that contribute to these changes. First, economic development has led to an increase in people's income, allowing them to afford a more diverse diet. Second, people's awareness of health has improved, and they now pay more attention to the nutritional balance of their diet. Third, the food industry has developed, providing a wider variety of food products. Finally, globalization has introduced more Western food habits to China, influencing people's dietary choices.\n\nIn conclusion, the Chinese diet has undergone significant changes over the past four decades, becoming more diverse and nutritious. These changes reflect the improvement in living standards and the shift in people's attitudes towards food and health."
